Covasim Webapp
==============

Covasim is a stochastic agent-based simulator designed to be used for COVID-19 (novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2) epidemic analyses. These include projections of indicators such as numbers of infections and peak hospital demand. Covasim can also be used to explore the potential impact of different interventions, including social distancing, school closures, testing, contact tracing, quarantine, and vaccination.

The scientific paper describing Covasim is available at http://paper.covasim.org. The recommended citation is:

Requirements
============

Python >=3.6 (64-bit). (Note: Python 2 is not supported.)

We also recommend, but do not require, using Python virtual environments. For
more information, see documentation for venv_ or Anaconda_.

.. _venv: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
.. _Anaconda: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html


Quick start guide
==================

Install with ``pip install covasim``. If everything is working, the following Python commands should bring up a plot::

  import covasim as cv
  sim = cv.Sim()
  sim.run()
  sim.plot()


GitHub installation instructions
==================================

1.  Clone a copy of the repository. If you intend to make changes to the code, we recommend that you fork it first.

2.  (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.

3.  Navigate to the root of the repository and install the Covasim Python package using one of the following options:

    *   To install with web app support (recommended)::

          python setup.py develop

    *   To install as a standalone Python model without webapp support::

          python setup.py develop nowebapp

    *   To install Covasim and optional dependencies (be aware this may fail since it relies on private packages), enter::

          python setup.py develop full

    The module should then be importable via ``import covasim as cv``.


Usage examples
==============

There are several examples in the `examples` directory. These can be run as
follows:

* ``python examples/simple.py``

  This example creates a figure using default parameter values.

* ``python examples/run_sim.py``

  This shows a slightly more detailed example, including creating an intervention and saving to disk.

* ``python examples/run_scenarios.py``

  This shows a more complex example, including running an intervention scenario, plotting uncertainty, and performing a health systems analysis.


Module structure
================

All core model code is located in the ``covasim`` subfolder; standard usage is
``import covasim as cv``. The other subfolders, ``data``, and ``webapp``, are
also described below.

The model consists of two core classes: the ``Person`` class (which contains
information on health state), and the ``Sim`` class (which contains methods for
running, calculating results, plotting, etc.).

The structure of the ``covasim`` folder is as follows, roughly in the order in which the modules are imported, building from most fundamental to most complex:

* ``version.py``: Version, date, and license information.
* ``requirements.py``: A simple module to check that imports succeeded, and turn off features if they didn't.
* ``utils.py``: Functions for choosing random numbers, many based on Numba, plus other helper functions.
* ``misc.py``: Miscellaneous helper functions.
* ``defaults.py``: The default colors, plots, etc. used by Covasim.
* ``parameters.py``: Functions for creating the parameters dictionary and loading the input data.
* ``plotting.py``: Plotting scripts, including Plotly graphs for the webapp (used in other Covasim classes, and hence defined first).
* ``base.py``: The ``ParsObj`` class, the fundamental class used in Covasim, plus basic methods of the ``BaseSim`` and ``BasePeople`` classes, and associated functions.
* ``people.py``: The ``People`` class, for handling updates of state for each person.
* ``population.py``: Functions for creating populations of people, including age, contacts, etc.
* ``interventions.py``: The ``Intervention`` class, for adding interventions and dynamically modifying parameters, and classes for each of the specific interventions derived from it.
* ``sim.py``: The ``Sim`` class, which performs most of the heavy lifting: initializing the model, running, and plotting.
* ``run.py``: Functions for running simulations (e.g. parallel runs and the ``Scenarios`` and ``MultiSim`` classes).
* ``analysis.py``: The ``Analyzers`` class (for performing analyses on the sim while it's running), the ``Fit`` class (for calculating the fit between the model and the data), the ``TransTree`` class, and other classes and functions for analyzing simulations.


Data
----

This folder contains loading scripts for the epidemiological data in the root ``data`` folder, as well as data on age distributions for different countries and household sizes.



Webapp
------

For running the interactive web application. See the `webapp README`_ for more information.

.. _webapp README: https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/covasim/tree/master/covasim/webapp


Other folders
=============

Please see the readme in each subfolder for more information.


Bin
---

This folder contains a command-line interface (CLI) version of Covasim; example usage::

  covasim --pars "{pop_size:20000, pop_infected:1, n_days:360, rand_seed:1}"

Note: the CLI is currently not compatible with Windows. You will need to add
this folder to your path to run from other folders. See the `bin README`_ for more information.

.. _bin README: ./bin


Data
----

Scripts to automatically scrape data (including demographics and COVID epidemiology data),
and the data files themselves (which are not part of the repository). See the `data README`_ for more information.

.. _data README: ./data


Docker
------

This folder contains the ``Dockerfile`` and other files that allow Covasim to be
run as a webapp via Docker. See the `Docker README`_ for more information.

.. _Docker README: ./docker


Examples
--------

This folder contains demonstrations of simple Covasim usage, including an early application of Covasim to the Diamond Princess cruise ship. See the `examples README`_ for more information.

.. _examples README: ./examples


WandB
~~~~~

Utilities for hyperparameter sweeps, using `Weights and Biases`_. See the `Weights and Biases README`_ for more information.
